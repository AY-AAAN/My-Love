Before you read the next letter, I just want to say something simple.
What you’re about to read comes from the deepest and softest parts of my heart.
It might be long, and it might be emotional,
but every word is real.

You are loved.
You are chosen.
You are one of the greatest blessings God has given me.

Always yours.">

data-text="My Baby,

We met on January 28, 2026 —
a day that seemed ordinary to everyone else,
but to me, it became the quiet beginning of everything.

If I had to search through every lifetime,
I would still find you.

Forever yours,
Always and in all ways.">
